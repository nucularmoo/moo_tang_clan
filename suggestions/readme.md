# Suggestions about the guild

Do you feel like there is something that the guild as such could be providing it's members, but is currently not doing?
If you want to make a suggestion about something in the guild you'd want to improve on, please make an issue in the repo, and the guild management will take it into consideration depending on the plausibility of the suggestion, once we have guild management installed.

Please take note that we will not necessarily be able to supply manpower with leadership skils for all such suggestions regarding events, so there is a chance that you will be required to take charge on handling the implementations of some types of suggestions yourself. We are expecting the events and activities organized by our guild to uphold certain standards, mainly regarding integrity relevant to a good spirit of fair play and honest gaming. Suggestions that infringe on what can be seen as any of these, or otherwise harmful for the guild, will not be considered, and as activities terminated.
